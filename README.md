# super-peach-world

Project realized for the js13k contest 2015. Theme is "reversed".

DONE:
- peach animation
- background with parallax
- peach movement
- variable jump height

TODO:
- game logo
- pitch with game rules
- platforms
- level design
- animals
- animals movement
- animals collection
- scoring
- timer

OPTIONAL TODO:
- animals collected follow peach
- online scoring with node
- mobile touch
- on borders of the world, move peach, not the camera (level design can avoid that)

PERF TODO:
- script to replace var names (constants, functions name) that uglify con't touch
- set images as base64, not files
