# super-peach-world

Project realized for the js13k contest 2015. Theme is "reversed".

DONE:
- peach animation
- background with parallax
- peach movement
- variable jump height
- platforms
- level design
- collisions with objects
- added goombas (sprite, animation, movement, collision)

TODO:
- game logo
- pitch with game rules
- several animals type (turtles)
- animals collection
- scoring
- timer

OPTIONAL TODO:
- animals collected follow peach
- online scoring with node
- mobile touch
- on borders of the world, move peach, not the camera (level design can avoid that)
- sound

PERF TODO:
- set images as base64, not files
